    <h4>Description</h4>
    Shin Ramyun was a staple growing up in a Korean immigrant household with two
     working parents. Looking back on it now, I think it helped that, though 
     these are instant noodles, theyâ€™re so much more substantial and filling than
     any of the other brands on the market, especially when you crack in an egg 
     at the end for extra protein. And at just a dollar or two a pop, it's one 
     of the cheapest meals I know.

        <li>1 Package of Ramen</li>
